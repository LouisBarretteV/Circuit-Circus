# Circuit-Circus
JavaFX application done in the context  of the final integrative project in the Computer Science and Mathematics program. Voted best project by my peers.

This application is an electronic circuits simulator in which wires, ground, resistors, voltage sources, 2 and 3 gates switches, transistors, diodes, inductors and capacitors can be used on a virtual breadboard to simulate their behaviors.

There are two main uses for the application: a "challenge" mode where users are presented with circuit analysis problems and a sandbox mode where users can build their own circuits.

In sandbox mode, users can select which element they want to place on their breadboard by choosing an element in the toolbox and then inserting it where they would like on the breadboard. Right-clicking on an element allows the user the edit the properties of the element. There are other features displayed on the right-click drop-down menu namely copying, cutting, deleting and rotating the selected element. Moreover, by pressing on the "File" tab at the top of the window, the user can opt to save the current file, load a previous one or create a new one altogether. The "Breadboard" tab is used to change the simulation speed of the circuit or to edit its ticks. The remaining features are self-evident when running the app. :)

Technologies and software used:
-Languages: CSS, Java (and JavaFX package)
-IDE: NetBeans
-Software: GIMP
